## Introduction

Groupie Trackers is a web project that uses an API to display data about bands and artists. The goal is to build a user-friendly website to show details like artist names, images, start years, first album dates, concert locations, and dates.

## Project Components

Artists - Basic artist info: name, image, start year, first album date.
Locations - Last or upcoming concert locations.
Dates - Last or upcoming concert dates.
Relation - Links the artist, dates, and locations data.

## Objective

Create an interactive site to show artist data in various views (cards, tables, pages, charts). Include a feature allowing users to interact with the server (client-server) to trigger and get information (request-response).

## Getting Started

Download the project: Use go run main.go to start the server.
Connect to API: Ensure server receives and displays data correctly.
Interactive Features: Test that client-server interactions work for requesting and fetching data.
